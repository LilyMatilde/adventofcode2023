# adventofcode2023

I have no idea what I am doing. I have not learned to use Github yet. So sorry if its confusing. Trying to learn as I go.
Anywho. 

In the branch Day1 Trebuchet? 
There is a code bit with a function which looks for a number in a string using the regular expression (number.includes(x) ? true:false; 
So what is means by x it means any number within the number variable that I created. (yes I made it confusing naming it number but it is my code)
